# Ads finder for Youtube

## Use

When you want to view the video page of a Youtube ad, right click on the ad video and select "*Copy debug informations*".
Then click the extension's icon. In the extension page, paste the content into the input field (Ctrl+V) and voilà! The video is opened for you in a new tab.


## Installation

This is not published on the Chrome store yet so you have to install it manually.

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeffMv/youtube-ads-util.git
```

To install it, use the development mode of Chrome. Here is a [tutorial](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/) for this.
You will have to select the folder `ads-finder-util` that is beneath this README.md file. (You do not select the root of the project).

## Further Improvements

- [ ] Putting the extension page into popup instead of a tab (when the extension button is clicked)
  - [ ] [Otherwise, by the time] Having only one extension tab opened per window (each window can have it's own tab)


## Thanks
